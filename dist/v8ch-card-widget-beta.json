    "description" : "The Rice Paper card widget is meant to extend the concept of the default text widget included with WordPress. It adds an image selectable via the built-in media uploader. And it can include excerpted content from selected categories. The widget is useful for building card-like layout components that can be placed in a widget area or, by using a <a href="https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/the_widget\/">built-in WordPress template tag<\/a>, may be dynamically placed anywhere on a template. Evolved from the excellent <a href="https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/image-widget\/">image widget<\/a> from Modern Tribe, the Rice Paper card widget includes a flexible layout template."
