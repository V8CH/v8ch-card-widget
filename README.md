The Rice Paper card widget is meant to extend the concept of the default text widget included with WordPress. It adds an image selectable via the built-in media uploader. And it can include excerpted content from selected categories. The widget is useful for building card-like layout components that can be placed in a widget area or, by using a [built-in WordPress template tag](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_widget/), may be dynamically placed anywhere on a template. Evolved from the excellent [image widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-widget/) from Modern Tribe, the Rice Paper card widget includes a flexible layout template.
