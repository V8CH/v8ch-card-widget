Description
-----------

The Rice Paper card widget is meant to extend the concept of the default text widget included with WordPress. It adds an image selectable via the built-in media uploader. And it can include excerpted content from selected categories. The widget is useful for building card-like layout components that can be placed in a widget area or, by using a [built-in WordPress template tag](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_widget/), may be dynamically placed anywhere on a template. Evolved from the excellent [image widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-widget/) from Modern Tribe, the Rice Paper card widget includes a flexible layout template.

Installation
------------

The Rice Paper theme and custom plugins are only available when bundled with deliverables presented by V8CH as part of a WordPress website development project. Once a website project has launched, copies of all V8CH themes and plugins are available by logging in to the V8CH website. Though they do not appear in the WordPress plugin repository, installation uses standard tools for [manual installation](http://ewp.guide/go/adding-new-plugin).

### Updates

Updates for all themes and plugins appear automatically using the [built-in WordPress updates system](http://ewp.guide/go/keeping-your-site-updated). All updates are tested before release, but it is good practice to perform a complete backup of all your data before updating any part of the WordPress system: core files, themes or plugins.
